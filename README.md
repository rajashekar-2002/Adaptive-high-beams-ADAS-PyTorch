📸 Spotting Vehicles at Night:
- Trained a PyTorch model to find cars 🔍
- categories to headlight and taillight
- Works when it's dark outside 🚗🌚
- Keeps headlights safe for everyone 🚦✨

🔦 Adjusting Headlights Automatically:
- Avoids blinding other cars' drivers 💡🚗
- Imagine a grid of 8x8 tiny lights 🎰🔳

📍 Precise Coordination:
- Knows where vehicles are located 🎯📊
- Low beams are always on 🛣️🚙
- Turns off specific light columns ⚡📉

🚫 Challenge to Overcome:
- struggles at longer distances 🕒🚗
- Light scatters beyond the controlled area 🌠
- Some dark regions might still get light☄️

🌌 Working Together - Python & Arduino:
- Python talks to Arduino using pyserial🐍🤖
- Arduino controls the LED matrix 🎮🌐

Let's brighten the way together, while we learn and improve! 🚀🌟
